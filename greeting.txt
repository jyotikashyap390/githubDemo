Formal greetings
1. How do you do?
2. Nice to meet you / Pleased to meet you
3. How have you been?
4. Good Morning / Good Afternoon / Good Evening

3. How have you been?
This is a polite way to ask “How are you?” when you have not seen a person for a long time. Ask this question only if you have met someone before.

A: How have you been?
B: I’ve been busy working a lot. How about you?
The best way to ensure that your greetings sound natural and confident is to practice them aloud, preferably with a fluent speaker to give you pointers. No-one to practice with? Find your perfect tutor.
