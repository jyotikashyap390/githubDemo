**Your goal is to generate a fast forward merge. Demonstrate that you understand how FF merges work by creating one on your own!**

Make a new branch. Do some work in the repo such that when you merge the new branch into master, it results in a fast forward merge.  Merge that branch into master and see if you were right!
